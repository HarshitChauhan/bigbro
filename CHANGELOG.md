# Change log

Notable changes to bigbro will be documented in this file, starting
with version 0.4.0.

* 0.4.0 - 2017-03-21

    - Renamed `bigbro_with_mkdir` to `bigbro`.  This is a
      backwards-incompatible change, but simplifies the API to a
      single function.  I think we can get away with this for now.
